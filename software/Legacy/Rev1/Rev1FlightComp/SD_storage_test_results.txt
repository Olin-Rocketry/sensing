The values are given as the range of durations in milliseconds over 5 cycles.
The notation 62-65 + 1051 means that four cycles had range 62-65 ms with one outlier at 1051 ms.

Conclusions: the Rev 1 code is significantly faster for writing to the SD card, but contains more frequent outliers
where the time is much longer.
These tests were also run while saving to the same file, which grew larger each time.
The time to open the SD card increases by a few milliseconds over about an hour of data logging.
